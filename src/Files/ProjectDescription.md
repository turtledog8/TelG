# Teamwork Guidelines

---

## Planning

### Step 1 – Create Your Repository
- Create a new organization on **GitHub**
- Add your teammate(s) as group members
- Create a new **private repository** in the organization
- Add your trainers as members with **Read** access
    - This will notify them by email with the repository URL
- Create a `README.md` containing project details

---

### Step 2 – Plan Your Tasks
Organizing your work is crucial to team success. Create a **GitHub Project board** and keep it updated.

#### Board Columns
- **Open** – backlog of all open issues
- **To do** – assigned and scheduled issues with deadlines
- **Doing** – issues currently in progress (max 2 per person)
- **For review** – issues pending teammate review
- **Closed** – completed issues

#### Issue Types

**Features**
- **Name** – feature/task title
- **Size** – Large / Medium / Small
- **Priority** – Must / Should / Could
- **Owner** – responsible team member

**Bugs**
- **Name** – description of the problem
- **Size** – Large / Medium / Small
- **Priority** – Must / Should / Could
- **Owner** – responsible team member

**Ideas**
- **Name** – short description of the idea

Reference: *GitHub Project Planning documentation*

## Step 3 – Coding
- Follow the project specification closely
- Avoid feature overload
- Implement fewer features **exceptionally well**

**Quality over quantity**

---

## Step 4 – Validation
- Review code written by teammates
- Test feature behavior
- Ensure all team members understand how each feature works

---

## Step 5 – Teamwork
Work together toward a shared goal:
- Agree on a common plan
- Take responsibility for assigned tasks
- Communicate and ask questions
- Be able to explain:
    - Your contribution
    - Your teammates’ source code

---

## Step 6 – Give Feedback About Your Teammates
You will provide feedback on:
- Attitude
- Technical skills
- Teamwork skills
- Contribution level

This feedback is a **critical part of project evaluation**. Be honest and thoughtful.

## Working Effectively in Teams

### Project Scope and Ground Rules
Establish clear objectives, norms, and roles.

Assign responsibilities for:
- Scheduling meetings
- Taking meeting notes
- Researching topics
- Presenting the project
- Creating timelines and task breakdowns

---

### Create a Timeline
- Prevent last-minute rush
- Estimate effort and dependencies
- Include buffer time for delays
- Assign tasks based on team member preferences
- Track tasks and time estimates in GitHub

---

### Schedule Meetings
- Meetings can be in-person or virtual
- Use them to share progress, ideas, and research

---

### Communication Ground Rules
- Agree on expectations for communication
- Example rules:
    - Respond within 24 hours if you miss a meeting
    - Lack of communication or contribution may affect credit
- Be understanding and inclusive

---

## Peer-to-Peer Feedback

### Keep a Positive Mindset
- Feedback is meant to help, not attack
- Deliver feedback with positive intent

---

### Be Specific and Actionable
- Offer concrete suggestions
- Focus on improvement, not criticism

---

### Focus on Problems, Not People
- Avoid personal language
- Use passive voice when helpful
- Example:
    -  “You didn’t provide enough data”
    -  “The presentation would be stronger with more data”

## Teamwork Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Description | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Scheduling problems | Conflicting schedules slow progress | Be understanding, use online tools, rotate meeting times |
| Group conflict | Disagreements escalate | Stay task-focused, address issues respectfully, find compromise |
| Uneven contribution | Some members contribute less | Set expectations early, assign roles, communicate directly |
| Different expectations | Different goals and work styles | Communicate early, align goals, create a shared timeline |
| Getting stuck | Mental roadblocks cause delays | Revisit requirements, brainstorm, seek help |
| Groupthink | Avoiding conflict reduces creativity | Encourage critical thinking and diverse opinions |
